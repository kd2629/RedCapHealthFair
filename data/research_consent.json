During the health fair, we will ask you questions about you and your health. Based on your answers, we may recommend screening tests for you to complete at the fair today. We will record your answers and results in a secure electronic record so that other volunteers can help you keep track of your results during the fair and help physicians provide advice at the end of the fair. DOCS is involved in a research study called \"Analysis of Participant Data from the Mitchell Wolfson Sr. Department of Community Service (DOCS) Health Fairs\" with Dr. Sabrina Taldone at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>PURPOSE OF STUDY:</strong></p> <p>We are asking you to take part in a research study because we are trying to learn more about how who attends DOCS health fairs and how the fairs are working. You will not be asked to do anything for the study besides participate in the fair today and agree to participate in the study.</p> <p>You will not benefit directly from or be paid for participating in this research study. Based on the study findings, DOCS health fairs might be improved so that they are more helpful for people that attend them in the future.</p> <p>There is always a small risk of breach of confidentiality. To minimize this risk, your name or identifiable information will not be associated with responses or results that may be studied. All of your answers and results will be coded by a special identifying number rather than your name or the ID number you will be given at the fair. All electronic data used for the study will be stored in computer files. Only people who are directly involved with the project will have access to those records. When the project is finished and results are reported, no individual will be identified in any way.</p> <p style=\"tab-stops: -1.5in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in;\">Your participation is voluntary. You can decline to participate, and you can stop your participation at any time, if you wish to do so, without any negative consequences to you. You can attend the health fair without participating in the study.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By you answering the survey/interview questions that I will ask, this means you consent to participate in this research project.\u00a0 Do you have any questions?</p> <p style=\"text-autospace: ideograph-numeric ideograph-other;\">If you have any questions or concerns about the research, please feel free to contact Dr. Sabrina Taldone at (305) 243-6499 or by mail at University of Miami - DOCS, 1600 NW 10th Ave RMSB 2017, Miami, FL 33136-1015<em>.</em></p> <p>If you have questions regarding your rights as a research participant, contact the University of Miami, Human Subject Research Office at (305)243-3195.</p> <p>\u00a0</p></div>",
